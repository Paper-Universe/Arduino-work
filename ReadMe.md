My end goal for this project is to help me build enough experience so I can start programming FPGA's

#What is HDL
To use an fpga you need to think about programming it differently when using an hdl language like vhdl, systemverilog, or verilog you need to think of the language as a stamp while the fpga is wax, so everytime you turn on the fpga your stamping a specific shape into the wax so that it knows how to function.
